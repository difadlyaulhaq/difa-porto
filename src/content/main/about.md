# Difa: Mobile Developer & AI Explorer

From zero coding experience to building tomorrow's solutions in Yogyakarta.

## My Journey

I wasn't born with a keyboard in my hands. Starting with nothing but curiosity and determination, I taught myself mobile development through late nights and countless debugging sessions. What began as tinkering turned into a passion that drives me every day.

## What I Do

* Build intuitive mobile experiences with Flutter
* Explore practical AI applications for real-world problems
* Study Informatics while applying knowledge through hands-on projects

## Why I Build

There's nothing quite like the feeling of bringing an idea to life through code. I'm fascinated by technology that makes a difference—not just innovation for its own sake, but solutions that solve genuine problems.

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
* Working on experimental side projects
* Contributing to tech communities in Yogyakarta
* Connecting with fellow builders and dreamers

## Let's Create Together

Whether you have a project idea, technical question, or just want to chat about the future of mobile and AI—I'd love to connect.
