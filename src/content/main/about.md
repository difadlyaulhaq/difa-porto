# i'm florian. i live in berlin, where i create things for the web.

i was one of the only kids in my class without a game console, but
we did have a computer. when i was 12, I got a coding book for
christmas and tried making my own games in C and opengl. though
i never finished any of those early projects, i got hooked on
programming.

after school, I started studying computer science and started
working as a software developer. i really love the web because
it's so accessible â€” anyone with a device and internet can access
your work instantly. publishing and sharing your work is also
pretty simple, whether as a website, a pwa, or a serverless
function/api.

in my free time, i build lots of web-based projects. i really like
the intersection of design and development. I love learning new
things and am always looking for new cool projects. If you want to
build something together or just want to connect, feel free to
