<ProjectGrid project={frontmatter}>
Daku Daku is a food ordering platform built in 36
hours during Garuda Hacks, an international
hackathon. It not only simplifies the ordering process
but also helps users track their calorie intake. After
completing an order, the system displays the total
calories consumed, enabling users to manage their
diet more effectively.
