WISE (Wound Identification System) is a Kotlin-based mobile application that utilizes machine learning for wound classification. The system employs a CNN model to identify different types of wounds, providing real-time analysis and first-aid recommendations. Optimized for TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) or cloud-based inference, WISE ensures efficient deployment on mobile devices. My contributions focus on developing and integrating the ML model, enhancing accuracy, and optimizing performance for seamless real-time wound classification within the app. This project was developed as the final capstone during my time at Bangkit.
